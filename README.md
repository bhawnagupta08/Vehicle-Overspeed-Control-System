# Vehicle-Overspeed-Control-System
This project is intended to develop a vehicle tracking and speed estimation using digital image processing technique. The software pre-processes video images using gray scale. Given a sequence of real-time video of traffic images. The images are converted to double precision images then edges are extracted and then quantified the resulting images to classify the objects and find the cars, after detecting the cars, they can be tracked in different frames and their speed can be estimated by calculating the position of the car object in different frames and compare it to a ground position.
